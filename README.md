# quickUbuntuBasedSetup
quick setup script

## How to use

if you really want to use it, just download it and:

```
chmod a+x qset.sh
sudo ./qset.sh
```

! Do not sudo things that you don't know. !

## Optional Flags
- `-re` installs `ubuntu-restricted extras` and MS Core Fonts
- `-dbwin` sets local time to RTC if you dual boot with Windows. (not really recommended but hey)
